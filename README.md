> [!NOTE]
> Libreri is close to its first public beta. Everything below is built and works on macOS, Windows and Linux; installers are not signed yet, so your system will ask once before opening it.

## Why Libreri

Most reading apps want your books in their cloud and your notes in their format. Libreri takes the opposite view: your library is a folder you own, your notes are plain Markdown next to it, and the app is simply a good place to read, think and remember.

<tr>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Yours, on disk

Books stay as the files they are. Notes, highlights and your reading calendar are kept beside them as readable files. Move the folder, sync it, back it up: every link still works.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Private by default

Nothing leaves your computer unless you ask for it. The speech, voice, OCR and maths models run on your machine. There are no accounts, no tracking, no ads.

</td>
<td width="33%" valign="top">

### Built for study

Highlights that link back to the page, a notebook per book, maths everywhere, flashcards from your own highlights, and search across every word you own.

## What you can do

### Keep a library

- **Bring books in** by dragging files or whole folders. Duplicates are recognised by their content, and books you move on disk are found again.
- **Organise** with real folders, tags, categories, ratings, reading status and favourites, and save any search as a **smart collection**.
- **Series** get their own view: every series with its covers, how far you are, and the next book to read.
- **Grid, list and shelf** views stay smooth with 10,000 books and more.
- **Fill in details** by ISBN, DOI, arXiv id or title from eight free sources, with covers. Scan a barcode with your camera or phone.
- **Search inside every book**, scans included: Tesseract reads scanned pages, or download PaddleOCR-VL to read tables and formulas too.
- **Look after it:** a health check, version history for edited PDFs, and automatic backups.

### Read comfortably

- **Tabs**, split view and separate windows, all remembered when you come back.
- **Nine page themes**, dark PDFs, brightness, contrast, text size and spacing; full screen, focus mode, two-page spreads, manga and webtoon modes.
- **Zoom** with buttons, Ctrl+scroll or a pinch, and **print** PDFs.
- **Look up** a word or a name you select: its meanings from Wiktionary, or a short Wikipedia summary, in the book's language.
- **ADHD reading:** bionic reading (on ebooks *and* on PDF and scanned pages), a line highlight under the pointer, and a reading mask.
- Works in **narrow windows**, down to a third of the screen.

### Take notes that last

- **Highlights** in four colours and **comments**, which can hold **maths** (`$x^2$`, `$$\int f$$`) drawn as you type.
- A **Markdown notebook** for every book, plus notes that belong to no book.
- **Markup** on PDF and comic pages: pen, shapes, stamps, signatures and a measuring tool.
- **Handwriting canvases** beside the book, with *clip from page* and *ink to text*.
- **Paper notes** photographed with your camera or phone, cleaned up and made searchable.
- **Voice notes** and **dictation**, written down on your computer.
- **Maths as LaTeX**, copied from the text or read from a picture of the page.
- A **Notes hub** that gathers everything across books, and exports to Markdown and Obsidian.

### Remember what you read

- **Daily review** turns your highlights into flashcards on a spaced schedule (FSRS, the method modern Anki uses): passages to complete, questions from your comments, and cloze cards that hide chosen words or whole formulas. Export them to **Anki** at any time.
- A **reading calendar** with month, week and day views, reading goals ("finish by…"), due dates, streaks and the pages a day to stay on track. Export it to any calendar app.
- A **study timer** with focus sessions, a countdown and a stopwatch. It counts as reading the open book, offers to note what you took away at each break, and shows in the macOS menu bar or the Windows and Linux tray.

### Listen

- **Read aloud** with the sentence highlighted and the page turning by itself, maths read as words, in your system's voices or **natural voices made on your computer**: Kokoro (54 voices in nine languages) and Piper (40+ languages, only voices free to use).
- **Audiobooks** with chapters, sleep timer and bookmarks, and an audiobook **linked to its ebook** so the page follows the voice.
- **Podcasts:** find shows (Apple Podcasts, or Podcast Index with your own key), follow them, stream or download, with Up next and a speed for each show. Transcripts and chapters follow along; shows without a transcript can be **written down on your computer**. **Note this moment** saves what was said into the notebook of the book you are reading, linked to the page.
- One **floating player** for all of it, which folds into a small box.

### Follow new research

- **Feeds** for arXiv categories and searches, journals, newsletters and blogs (RSS, Atom, OPML), in folders.
- **Download** papers and articles (as clean Markdown), read them in the full reader, and **add them to your library** with authors, abstract, DOI, arXiv id and journal already filled in.
- **Share** a paper as a link, a BibTeX citation or a Markdown link.

### Edit PDFs safely

- **Pages:** reorder, rotate, delete, insert, crop, extract, split and merge.
- **Redaction** that truly removes the text, **text corrections** and **forms**.
- Make files smaller, and write OCR text into scans.
- Every save keeps the **previous version**, and your notes move to the right pages.

### Share a computer

- **Profiles** with 6-digit PINs, auto-lock, **Kids** profiles limited to chosen folders, and **guests** who leave nothing behind.
- Everyone keeps their own notes, places, collections, feeds, podcasts, flashcards and calendar.

### Work your way

- **100+ keyboard shortcuts**, all changeable, a command palette (Ctrl+K), and optional Vim keys.
- **Accessible:** screen-reader labels, strong contrast and visible keyboard focus throughout.
- **Spell check** in 45+ languages, with word completion that learns from your books.
- **Export** to Libreri archives, CSV, Excel, JSON, BibTeX, RIS, CSL-JSON, Obsidian and Calibre; **import** from Calibre, Zotero, Mendeley, Goodreads and StoryGraph.
- **Backups and archives** carry everything: books, notes, flashcards, the calendar, feeds and podcasts.
- **Updates itself** when a new version is out, after asking you.

## What goes online

Only what you ask for, and only the minimum:

| When you… | Libreri contacts | It sends |
|---|---|---|
| Fill in a book's details | Open Library, Google Books, Crossref, arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar (ISBNdb and ComicVine with your own key) | The ISBN, DOI, arXiv id or title |
| Look up a word | Wiktionary, Wikipedia | The selected words and the book's language |
| Follow feeds or podcasts | The feed's own site; Apple Podcasts or Podcast Index to search | The address, or your search words |
| Download a voice, model or dictionary | Its official download site | Nothing about you |
| Check for updates | GitHub (Libreri's releases) | Nothing about you |

Your books, notes, highlights and reading habits never leave your computer. The full [privacy policy](PRIVACY.md) explains it in more detail.

## Formats

| | Formats |
|---|---|
| **Documents** | PDF (with forms), DjVu |
| **Ebooks** | EPUB, MOBI, AZW3, FB2 (DRM-free) |
| **Text** | Markdown (maths, Mermaid diagrams, code), RTF, plain text |
| **Comics** | CBZ, CBR, CB7, CBT, CBA |
| **Audio** | MP3, M4B, M4A, AAC, OGG, Opus, FLAC, and podcasts |

A few formats use small **helper programs**, which Libreri installs with one click (Homebrew, winget, apt, dnf, pacman or zypper). The Flatpak has them built in, except unar:

| Helper | Used for |
|---|---|
| DjVuLibre | DjVu books |
| Tesseract | OCR and searchable scans |
| unar | CBA (ACE) comics; optional |
| eSpeak NG | Read aloud where the system has no voices, and natural voices |

Optional **downloads**, each with its own Delete button: natural voices (Kokoro and Piper), speech models (whisper.cpp), the PaddleOCR-VL model, the pix2tex maths model, dictionaries, OCR languages and canvas fonts.

## Your library on disk

```
My Library/
├── Books/              your books and audiobooks, in your own folders
├── Notes/<profile>/    notebooks, canvases, voice notes, paper notes, web pages
├── Feeds/<profile>/    papers, articles and podcast episodes you downloaded
└── .library-data/      the catalogue, covers, versions, and a JSON copy of every
                        book's details, your highlights, flashcards and calendar
```

Only relative paths are stored, so a library can be moved, synced or opened on another computer. The catalogue can be rebuilt from the files at any time, and nothing is ever kept only inside the database. Every file is written aside and swapped in, so a sudden quit never leaves half a file. More in [data portability](docs/data-portability.md).

## Install

Download the installer for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/avmg0/Libreri/releases): a `.dmg` for macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), an `.msi` or `.exe` for Windows, and an AppImage, `.deb` or `.rpm` for Linux. Each release also has a Flatpak (`Libreri.flatpak`) with its helper programs built in; Flathub is on its way ([details](flatpak/README.md)).

Until the builds are signed, your computer asks before opening Libreri the first time:

- **macOS:** the first time you open it, macOS says it "could not verify" Libreri. Click **Done**, open **System Settings › Privacy & Security**, scroll down to *"Libreri.app" was blocked* and click **Open Anyway**, then enter your password. Or, in Terminal: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Libreri.app`.
- **Windows:** if SmartScreen appears, choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.

After that, Libreri tells you when a new version is ready (Settings › General › Updates).

### Open books with Libreri

Libreri can open PDF, EPUB, Kindle (MOBI, AZW3), FB2, DjVu, comic (CBZ, CBR, CB7, CBT, CBA) and M4B files from your file manager. A book already in your library opens straight away; any other file is added first (copied, unless you choose to move it). To make Libreri the default for a type:

- **macOS:** right-click a file › **Get Info** › **Open with** › choose Libreri › **Change All…**
- **Windows:** right-click a file › **Open with** › **Choose another app** › Libreri › **Always**. Or Settings › Apps › Default apps › Libreri.
- **Linux:** right-click a file › **Open With** › Libreri, and set it as the default there (or in a terminal: `xdg-mime default Libreri.desktop application/pdf`; for the Flatpak, `io.github.avmg0.Libreri.desktop`).

## Build from source

**You need**

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs) via rustup. The right version (1.95) is installed automatically from `rust-toolchain.toml`.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) 10 (`corepack enable`).
- Tauri's [platform prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/):
  - **macOS** 13.3 or newer: Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).
  - **Linux:** `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev`.
  - **Windows:** Microsoft C++ Build Tools and WebView2 (included with Windows 11).

**Run**

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # the app, with hot reload
pnpm build        # installers in target/release/bundle/
```

The development build is much slower than the finished app; build it to judge speed.
